        Hey [Her Name],<br/><br/>

        To be honest, the moment I saw you in the VAC class, I was mesmerized by you. 😍 I couldn’t stop admiring you. I can still feel the thrill of seeing your bright, confident face. It was such a pleasant feeling that I never want to fade away. ✨<br/><br/>

        I don’t think you noticed, but I was staring at you the whole class. 👀 Getting your number wasn’t difficult, but texting you was a challenge. 📱 I had to gather all my courage to send you that first message. Since that day, I can’t stop thinking about you—day and night, you are always in my mind and heart. 💭❤️<br/><br/>

        Only I know how much time I spend looking at and admiring your pictures. Today, I finally gathered the courage to express my sincere feelings, even though I’m shaking with fear about what might happen next. 😅 Somehow, I managed to do this.<br/><br/>

        Do you remember the day we went around the college together and had those little conversations? It was the most amazing moment. I was so happy that day that I couldn’t even sleep at night because you were all over my soul. 🥰<br/><br/>

        I just wanted to say that I really like you and want you to be mine. 💕<br/><br/>

        Would you be my girlfriend? ❤️
